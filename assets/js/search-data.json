            "title": "Religion and homosexuality",
            "content": "This article is a personal reflection of Pew Research Center&#39;s analysis on the acceptability of homosexuality, particularly focused on religion. This survey was conducted among 38,426 people in 34 countries from May 13 to Oct. 2, 2019. It included a variation of face to face interviews and phone calls in different countries where the survey took place. The full question to the survey in this analysis was, &quot;And which one of these comes closer to your opinion? Homosexuality should be accepted by society OR Homosexuality should not be accepted by society.” . Notes:To get more details on the methods and how this survey was conducted, read the full article here. . The question stated above was first asked in the U.S. by the Pew Research Center in 1994 and was later asked globally in 2002. The survey went on to be conducted in 2007, 2011, 2013, and recently in 2019. Hence, this is survey is a follow up to the one conducted in 2013. The question asked is a long-term trend to be continuously observed and some of the changes recorded over the years were substantial. . The changes in the perceptions toward homosexuality have most certainly taken a positive turn in many countries as they have begun to embrace homosexuality in societies. Many are also supportive in the legalization of gay marriages. But on the other end of the spectrum, some countries are still hesitant to accept this sexual orientation or the idea of being attracted to another individual of the same sex. The full article put out by Pew Reseach Center mentions the many different factors that contribute to the varying results of acceptance, and some of which included a country&#39;s wealth, an individual&#39;s age, education, income, gender, political ideology and also religion. . . Poeple with individual fundamental religious beliefs in these countries also have opposing views with the notion of homosexuality being accepted by society. In 25 out of the 34 countries surveyed, those who say religion is important are less likely to say that homosexuality should be accepted than those who say religion is &quot;somewhat&quot;, &quot;not too&quot; or &quot;not at all&quot; important in their lives. . Interestingly, the significant differences could be observed in countries such as Israel (40%), Czech Republic (38%), South Korea (38%), Canada (33%), the United States (29%), Slovakia (29%), Greece (28%), and Turkey (26%). . This survey also attributed these opposing views to religious affiliations. It was mentioned as a huge factor contributing to the results of the acceptance of homosexuality within this particular category. The comparisons were between religious &quot;nones&quot; (those who identify as atheist, agnostic or &quot;nothing in particular&quot;) and those who are religiously affiliated (e.g. Christians, Buddhist, Muslims, etc.) Those who are unaffiliated to a religion tend to say that homosexuality should be accepted by society. .

            "title": "Penguins in Antarctica",
            "content": ". About . The data that was used for this week&#39;s project were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER. Palmer Station is one of three United States research stations located on Anvers Island in the Antarctic Peninsula. They are also part of the Long Term Ecological Research Network who studies ecological processes. With the help of the palmerpenguins package in R, some of the variables that were used for this analysis were the penguin&#39;s flipper length, culmen length, body mass, species, and the islands they can be found on. . The data . Along the Palmer archipelago, three out of the nineteen species of penguins could be found. They are the Chinstrap penguins, Gentoo penguins, and the Adélie penguins. These three penguin species are of the genus Pygoscelis and are also known as the brush-tailed penguins. A unique quality one can observe from these brush-tailed penguins is their brush-like tails that they use as a rudder whenever they swim under water. . Location . They can be found on three islands along the Anvers region of the Antarctic peninsula. As seen above, Adélie penguins can be found on Biscoe, Dream, and Torgersen island. Chinstraps are mostly found on Dream island and Gentoos mostly on Biscoe island only. . Culmen and flipper comparison . . Note: The culmen length is on the x-axis and the flipper length is on the y-axis. Each colour and shape reflects the three different species. . . The brush-tailed penguin species are mostly medium to large sized when compared to other species. With the information collected by Palmer Station, their size proportion could also be analyzed. In the visual above, the culmen length and flipper length was observed. These birds usually use their culmen to collect stones for the building of their nest when they start breeding. Stones are, in fact, the only material available to these penguins and the Pygoscelis penguins are the only species to do so. . Size comparison by island . Size comparison by sex . Out of the three species, the Gentoos and a small proportion of Adélies found mostly on Biscoe and Dream island are the biggest in terms of its flipper length and its body mass. Adélie males are also generally bigger than the females whereas, Gentoo males are almost the same size as the females. .
