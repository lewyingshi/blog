    "The Internet is a link. One that tethers us to answers, education, opportunities, and a plethora of other things. Most of us are oblivious to what it is exactly other than to leisurely browse through hours of Youtube videos, scroll through hundreds of Instagram and Facebook posts, or notoriously start threads of banter on Twitter. The [Internet](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/22/what-is-the-internet-13-key-questions-answered) is in fact a network that connects individuals, organizations, governments, educational institutions and companies through a series of cables that run for thousands of miles. This complex infrastructure is what connects us all. But are we all connected?\n",

    "The past year has shown everyone that it is imperative to have an online and virtually connected community. Since the pandemic began, many are missing out such opportunities, and more are unable to attain a proper education via online communication platforms. The pandemic has since continue to affect families, communities, and countries worldwide. COVID-19 has indeed exacerbated the gender divide and elucidated existing disparities. It is known that about half the world's population are currently [online](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/22/what-is-the-internet-13-key-questions-answered). More importantly, the other half do not have access to the Internet at all. The majority of these offline population are women in Low- and Middle- Income Countries (LMIC). \n",

    "To get more information about the digital gender gap, we can explore the data. The data comes from the [Inclusive Internet Index](https://theinclusiveinternet.eiu.com/), a project of the [Economist Intelligence Unit](https://www.eiu.com/n/). The data shows gender inequity in access to the Internet and mobile phones. The differences are perpetually rising in some countries, stagnant in some, and only a small proportion that shows progress. "

    "To communicate is also to stay connected. Unfortunately, many also do not have equal access to mobile phones. The comparison above also shows the gender gaps in different countries, but it is filtered with access to both the Internet and to mobile phones. Pakistan has the largest difference of male to female access with each reaching about 71%. Phillipines has about 14% more females accessing the Internet than males and only a small percentage of males exceeding females in having access to mobile phones, a good sign.
