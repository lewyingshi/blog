My name is Yingshi Lew, better known as Dennis. This space is a personal website made with the intent of sharing my journey and my work. With an interest for data visualization and graphics reporting, the goal is to improve my skills in storytelling through data. As time progresses, I'm looking forward to seeing growth in both my knowledge and my understanding of data by immersing myself in an expansive range of topics and writing about them.
