Hi there!

I am Dennis. <br>
I've ventured into hosting my very own blog to record my progress and my work with data visualization. 
As a data science student and a data visualization/graphics reporting enthusiast, my goal here is to improve my skills in areas of storytelling and its required technicalities. 
I'm looking forward to share my growth journey and my passion for data viz by immersing myself in an expansive range of topics from different platforms such as 
#MakeoverMonday, TidyTuesday, and various other data sources. 
I will be sharing observations and takeaways from each datasets. Enjoy!
