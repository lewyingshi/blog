My name is Yingshi Lew, better known as Dennis. <br>This space is a personal portfolio made with the intent of sharing my journey and my work. As a data visualization and graphics reporting enthusiast, my goal is to improve my skills in storytelling with data. As time progresses, I'm looking forward to seeing growth in both my knowledge and my understanding of data by immersing myself in an expansive range of topics. I will be analyzing data and writing about what I've learnt, at the same time, attempting to make interesting visualizations for readers to learn from. Enjoy!

This site is built with [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages), an easy to use blogging platform with extra features for Jupyter Notebooks.
