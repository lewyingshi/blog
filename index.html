My name is Yingshi Lew, better known as Dennis. 
<br>This blog acts as one of my long-term projects that will record my progress and my journey. 
As a data visualization/graphics reporting enthusiast, my goal is to improve my skills in storytelling with data. 
As time progresses, I'm looking forward to seeing growth in both my knowledge and my understanding of data analysis by immersing myself in an expansive range of topics. 
Here, I will be writing about what I've learnt from different datasets, at the same time, attempting to make interesting visualizations for readers to learn from. Enjoy!

This site is built with [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages), an easy to use blogging platform with extra features for Jupyter Notebooks.
