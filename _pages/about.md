My name is Dennis. I am currently a senior at Winona State University with a major in Data Science. I have a fond interest in visualizing data, as well as reading tons of articles that utilizes this method to inform and teach others. I hope to do the same in my career in the future, hence, I am using this blog as a stepping stone.  

I also love food. In my free time, I usually boulder or watch movies.
