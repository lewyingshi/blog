My name is Dennis. I am currently a senior at Winona State University with a major in Data Science. I have a fond interest in visualizing data. I love spending my time reading tons of articles that utilizes this method to inform and teach others. I aspire to do the same in my future career, hence, I am using this blog as a stepping stone.

Aside from work, I also love good food, bouldering and watching movies.
