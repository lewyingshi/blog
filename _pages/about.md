My name is Dennis. I am currently a senior at Winona State University with a major in Data Science. I have a fond interest in visualizing data. I love spending my time reading articles that utilize this method of storytelling. I aspire to do the same in my future career, hence, I am using this blog as a stepping stone. 

Aside from a lot independent learning on becoming better at this craft, I also love good food, good movies, and good company.
